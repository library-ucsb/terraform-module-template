# Terraform Module Template - Initialization

This is the 'initialization' branch of this repo, designed to establish the github repository
used to house this module.

After running the initialization terraform plan, you will have the infrastructure in place to begin working
on your module.  Be sure to begin your module work out of the 'main' branch, leaving the 'init' branch independent.
